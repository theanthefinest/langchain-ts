# Langchain (TypeScript) — Small example project

A compact TypeScript project demonstrating a simple LangChain-style structure for building chains and services. This README explains the project layout, how to set up the environment, how to run the project, and where to look to extend it.

## What this repository is

- A lightweight scaffold for experimenting with chain-like components in TypeScript.
- Minimal project to explore connecting models, chains, and services.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Any environment variables required by your services (e.g., API keys). See `src/utils/env.ts` for hints.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

2. Build (if you want a compiled run)

```bash
npm run build
# typically runs `tsc` and outputs to `dist/`
```

3. Run (dev)

```bash
npm run dev
# or run compiled output
# node dist/main.js
```

If the project does not include these scripts, running TypeScript directly with `ts-node` is an alternative (install `ts-node` and `typescript` if needed):

```bash
npx ts-node src/main.ts
```

## Project structure

Key files and folders:

- `src/main.ts` — entry point.
- `src/chains/chain.ts` — chain implementation / example.
- `src/interface/interface.ts` — shared interfaces and types.
- `src/model/gemi.ts` — model wrapper or adapter.
- `src/service/` — services used by chains or models.
- `src/utils/env.ts` — environment variable loader / helpers.

Use these files as the starting point to implement or extend custom chains and model adapters.

## Environment & configuration

This project likely depends on runtime environment variables (API keys, endpoints). Create a `.env` file or set environment variables in your shell. Typical variables you may need:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — if you use OpenAI models.
- `API_URL` — any custom service endpoints.

Note: The exact variable names and usage are defined in `src/utils/env.ts` and other service files. Check those files and adjust your `.env` accordingly.

## How to extend

- Add new chain logic in `src/chains/`.
- Add new model adapters in `src/model/`.
- Register or wire services inside `src/service/` and import them in `src/main.ts`.

## Example usage

Open `src/main.ts` to see how chains and models are instantiated and used. Use that as a reference for wiring new components.

## Tests

There are no tests included by default. If you add tests, prefer Jest or vitest for TypeScript, and add an npm script like:

```json
"test": "vitest"
```

## Troubleshooting

- If TypeScript build fails, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to see errors.
- If runtime errors reference missing env variables, check `src/utils/env.ts` and ensure your `.env` or environment provides the required keys.

## Contributing

Small changes are welcome. Keep changes focused and add a short note in this README describing any new environment variables or scripts you add.
